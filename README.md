For this project, we use environmental data to predict corn yields in the United States. We use air quality data from the Environmental Protection Agency and drought data from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln as our indepedent variables, and train our model on corn yield data from the United States Department of Agriculture. We include exploratory data visualizations as well as summarize our findings and discuss potential opportuntities for improvement of our models and methods.
